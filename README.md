# Linkedin_analytics_data
Python scripts to update Linkedin analytics 

## Problem to solve
> **Client:** It took me about a whole day to update Linkedin data from my customers.

> **Me:** Why?

> **Client:** I need to download datasets from 3 different Excel files to feed my Data Studio dashboards.

> **Me:** Doesn't Linkedin have tools for marketing people like you?

> **Client:** They are expensive and they don't always work as I'd like. I just need all the data updated without all the copy-pasting.

> **Me:** Ok. So you want to download those 3 files (followers, visitors and updates) from Linkedin and *magically* update the datasource file (.xlsx) for your dashboards?

> **Client:** Yes

> **Me:** You know that is not the best solution?

> **Client:** Yes, but it is all I need for now.

> **Me:** Ok. Let me give those Python online courses a try.
